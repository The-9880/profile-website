                            <p>Learning project following my study of RBMs in Geoffrey Hinton's Coursera course on neural networks.
                            In this project, I aimed to train a generative model to learn a probability distribution through its
                            hidden states so that it would create reconstructions that capture the regularities of digits seen in
                            the MNIST dataset's digits. This implementation uses Gibbs Sampling for MCMC sampling.

                                The gallery page makes use of jQuery to add a third column of images on wider displays.
